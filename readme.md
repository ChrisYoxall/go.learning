To run:  Doing 'go run main.go' executes program.

To build: Doing 'go build main.go' will generate an executable.

Use of the package name 'main' (reserved word) means that will generate an executable. The 'main.go' file needs a function called 'main'

To enable 'go test' to work created a package by doing 'go mod init example/cards'


An array has a fixed size. A slice (data type in its own right) is a dynamically-sized flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

A struct is a collection of fields.



Go is not an Object Oriented language. Patterns that get used in go are:

    - Define methods on types by adding a receiver in argument lists between the func keyword and method name. Functions with recievers are referred to as methods.
